<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and fast-learning IT professional with over two years of experience in application development using Microsoft Power Platform, including Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI. I graduated with a degree in Information Technology and have built a strong foundation in low-code solutions, business process automation, and data visualization.</p>

<p>During my time at Accenture, I worked as a Software Engineering Associate where I developed and maintained custom business applications for enterprise clients. I was responsible for designing Power Apps interfaces, creating automated workflows, and generating interactive dashboards that improved efficiency and decision-making. My ability to quickly adapt to new tools and solve problems has been consistently recognized by my leads and peers.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I value teamwork, continuous learning, and delivering solutions that create real business value. I am now seeking new opportunities where I can grow further as a Power Platform Developer and contribute to impactful digital transformation projects.</p>
